# Schedule Module

## Purpose

The schedule module allows users to create, edit, delete, and view appointments for preexisting sessions, as well as keep track of data entry status.

+ Live Filtering

## Interactions with LORIS

The Schedule module depends on the session table; appointments can only be created for already existing sessions.

The appointment list links to the candidate's visit list and the timepoint for the appointment.
